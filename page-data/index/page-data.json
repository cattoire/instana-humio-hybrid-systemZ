The first tab will be this lab guide.

It is named Student1. This \n  virtual machine is the Client machine from which you will access the different environments.\n\n  ![](../images/Skytap.png)\n\n  If the background is green, it means the virtual machine is running.  If it is not running, click the start arrow to start the VM\n  ![](../images/2021-04-27-20-00-11.png)\n\n\n\n  For more information on using the soleil environment, scroll towards the bottom of the page.\n\n## Begin the Exercises\n\nYou are now ready to start performing the lab exercises.  After that, the sections can be done in any order.  For a new user of Instana, we recommend \nperforming the **Explore Instana** section of the lab next.  If you are already familiar with Instana, you can select immediately the systemZ lab.\n\nSelect one of the lab exercises in the upper left corner or select one of the images below.\n\n\n<Row>\n\n<Column colLg={2} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Explore Instana\"\n    title=\"Explore the Instana UI and Capabilities\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Explore\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](../images/InstanaTopology.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Instana and the mainframe\"\n    title=\"Learn How Instana Can Help you with hybrid applications that include Mainframe components\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Instana on Z\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](../images/instanaEvents.png)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n***\n\n\n## Using the soleil environment\n\n  There are a couple of things that are important to know when using the soleil environment.  At the top of the screen you will see a menu bar.  You'll notice a full screen icon as shown below. You'll have a much better experience with the lab if you use full screen.\n\n  ![](../images/2021-04-27-20-24-32.png)\n\n  Another icon on the taskbar that is important is the clipboard icon\n\n  ![](../images/2021-04-28-10-47-13.png)\n\n  The only way to paste content into the virtual machine is by using this icon.\n\n  To copy text into the virtual machine, perform a copy as you normally would do on your laptop/desktop.  Then, click the clipboard icon. You will notice that there is text within the clipboard user interface\n\n  ![](../images/2021-04-27-20-40-37.png)\n\n  This will make the text available within the virtual machine. Then, within the virtual machine, either type \"Ctrl-V\" or right-click and use your browser to paste the text into the virtual machine.\n\n  To copy text from the virtual machine, do the process in reverse.  Copy the text inside the virtual machine.  Then, click the clipboard icon and you will notice that the text is visible on the screen.\n\n  ![](../images/2021-04-27-20-40-37.png)\n\n  Whatever text you see on the VM clipboard, you'll be able to past within your laptop/desktop.\n\n  Note:  The clipboard is a little bit unreliable.  You may need to attempt to copy/paste a couple of timess.  Also, try to avoid clicking in multiple places on the screen. Copy the content (Ctrl-C), click on the clipboard, then immediately paste to either your laptop or into the virtual machine.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d72de9e23da6ae679995cc46b232adac","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":266},"frontmatter":{"title":"Think Lab 1201 - Using Instana to  achieve observability including the mainframe","description":"Observability of a hybrid application using Instana including mainframe"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"--- \ntitle: Think Lab 1201 - Using Instana to  achieve observability including the mainframe\ndescription: Observability of a hybrid application using Instana including mainframe\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis lab will introduce Instana and then illustrate how it can be used for an application which makes use of some mainframe components.\n\nWe have already instrumented the application for you and through the various lab exercises you will explore the capabillities of the combination of Instana.\n\n1) In the first portion of the lab, students will get a good idea of the standard capabillities of Instana.
